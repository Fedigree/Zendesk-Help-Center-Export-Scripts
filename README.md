# Zendesk Guide Article Data Export

### Summary
Navigating and using the [Zendesk Help Center API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/help_center/introduction) can be a challenging but often necessary experience.

Exporting Zendesk Guide data requires extracting the information via their API. The Python scripts included in this repository
will export the data to a .csv file. This facilitates more control over Zendesk Help Center information and an expanded ability to obtain actionable data.

This process can be a little rough, so any contributions, notes, feedback, etc. is greatly appreciated!

### Dependencies
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferred)
* Python 2
* [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

### Notes
The requests library suggests use of Python 3. Scripts will reflect subtle differences.
